Variables is a nice way of saying that the class has values in it. It's a 
way of storing information into the class, almost like the storage room in 
a basement. Each of the "storage" articles have different names/groups, and 
each can hold a different value. Each specific variable has their own function 
as well. These are called "DataTypes" For example:

int = integers - The integer represents a full number value that the variable has.
    public "int" cookies = 1;  -we now know that "cookies" has a value of two.

float = float - The float is a way to use decimal points. It's not the full number like
an integer would be.
    public "float" cookies = .75; - a bite has been taken out of the cookie, so now we
only have three quaters of it left. 

double = double - The double is basically a way of doubling the float. 
    public "d" = 10.10;

bool = Booleon - Booleon is a way for the operator to assign a value to the variable.
Usually seen as a "true or false"
    booleon user = true;
